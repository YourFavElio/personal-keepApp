This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Personal Google Keep App

This small project was made to practice my React skills. Includes very basic styling and absolutely no backend.

Notes won't be stored in any way and will disappear every time you restart the app.

To try it out you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## This version will need a backend server to make it work. Will be uploaded in a while

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
