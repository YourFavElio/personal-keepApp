This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Personal Google Keep App

This small project was made to practice my React skills. Includes VERY BASIC styling.

To try it out you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Backend uploaded.
Use this command to start server.
### node index.js

You will need to add your own personal MongoDB connection URL.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Final thoughts
<ul>
<li>This code could totally use some refactoring;</li>
<li>Displaying notes from the final <App /> component could've been done with less instructions;</li>
<li>For next project will need to have better understanding of the whole architecture I'm going to create, before jumping in and coding;</li>
</ul>
